# Github API

## Purpose:

The purpose of this project was to utilize the Github API in order to see my projects and reinforce some of the ideas of React using Lifecycle Methods. This is most likely going to be a building block for my portfolio.

## Resources Used:

- [Github API Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)
- [React Lifecycle Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#the-component-lifecycle)
